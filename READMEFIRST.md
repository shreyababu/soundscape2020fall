Guidelines for a Soundscape Narrative project, part of [Ben Miller's Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2020fall) course

Welcome to my Soundscape Narrative! 
This piece is meant to depict joyful life before the year 2020 transitioning into a series of chaotic and devestating events.
This year has felt never-ending, and my narrative works to translate that into the literal.
I hope you enjoy "Year After Year". 

(The main .aup is titled Year After Year).
