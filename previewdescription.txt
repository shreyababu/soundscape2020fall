In this preview, I have created my opening sounds for the dinner party that 
is occurring on New Year’s Eve going into 2020. There is loud laughing, distant chatter, 
mini snippets of louder voices having conversations, dishes and glasses clinking, etc. 
This scene has been put together to indicate the usual happy and excited mood of a New Year’s party. 
The people then start to count down from 10, and then once they’ve hit 1, fireworks burst and cars honk, 
and people are cheering and clapping. (By the way, the sounds of the people counting down need to be 
replaced with a better sound because it sounds SO fake, but it’s just a placeholder for now!). 
Most of the sounds have been taken from an online source, but I recorded myself saying 
“I know, I’m so excited!” and “Okay, it’s almost time!” because they were very specific 
sentences I wanted to include. This exuberant opening tone is to be contrasted later on with 
the quiet, rainy, dark New Year’s Eve that will occur after the year has passed in my narrative. 
That scene will feature sniffling, sighing, rain and thunder sounds, quiet TV in the 
background, and more. This will follow the flashing news clips of all the bad things that have 
happened so far in 2020, thus the more dreadful tone that sets up the year 2021. I have managed 
to create about 45 seconds of the opening scene, subject to change of course. One question I 
have is: once I have finalized this opening scene, am I allowed to save it as an mp3 and then
start a new audacity file and import the mp3 (basically compressing the amount of clips that 
will be present in the final version to make it easier to sort through)? I know this may not 
be possible as it would not show the full data that is present because you would not 
be able to see the individual files of the opening scene.
